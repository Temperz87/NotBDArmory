The mod is available for down load [here](https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/m7yeacic/).
Most of the logic for this mod is in CustomWeaponHandler, HarmonyPatches/LoadoutConfigurator, and MonoHelper. The code is fairly convuluted right now, so I'm sorry about that but messing with the weapon manager is a bit stupid atm.
