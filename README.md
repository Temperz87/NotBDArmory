The mod hasn't been released yet, but when it is you'll be able to download it from [here](https://vtolvr-mods.com/).
Most of the logic for this mod is in CustomWeaponHandler, HarmonyPatches/LoadoutConfigurator, and MonoHelper. The code is fairly convuluted right now, so I'm sorry about that but messing with the weapon manager is a bit stupid atm.
